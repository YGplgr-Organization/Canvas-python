<h1>gCADvas: CAD experiment on Gnome canvas</h1>
<h4>1/18/04</h4>

<p>
One of the benefits of having an only *moderately* functional 2D CAD app
written in a very *compact* manner with a powerful, easy to learn language
like Python is that it should serve as a useful starting point for others
wanting to modify, extend or improve the code.
This is my excuse for keeping the code to its bare essentials, only
reluctantly adding features unless I can figure out how to do so with a
minimum of new code.</p>
<p>So here it is. A small python file called
<a href="gcadvas.py">gcadvas.py</a>
which provides some basic CAD functionality and gives an opportunity to
evaluate the suitability of this approach.</p>
<p>So far, I am quite pleased with the amount of functionality I am
able to achieve with a small amount of python code. However, some
compromises have been made. For example, using the gnome canvas, I am
constrained to select at most one canvas item at a time. It is not
possible to select two lines simultaneously and then calculate their
intersection. As a result, I found it necesary to generate selectable
"intersection points" anywhere that I want to be able to select an
intersection point. To keep from having a ridiculous number of these
points, I decided to create them only for intersections of "construction
type" lines. I have defined two distinct types of lines, each with its own
"rules" governing behavior for screen picks. The distinctions to be
made between these two basic types of lines are as follows:
<h3>Construction Lines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Construction lines are "infinite" in length and are intended to be
used temporarily to assist in the creation of "real" geometry.</li>
<li>Construction lines have "clickable" intersection points.</li>
<li>Clicking on a construction line does not select a point, but
rather selects the line itself. This is needed for some operations such
as creation of parallel and perpendicular lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geometry Lines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Geometry lines are finite length "segments".</li>
<li>Clicking on a geometry line or arc selects the end point closest to
the point clicked.</li>
<li>CTRL-SHIFT click on a geometry line selects the midpoint.</li>
<li>CTRL-SHIFT click on a circle or arc selects the center.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other mouse button shortcuts</h3>
<ul>
<li>CTRL-LMB on the canvas pans the view.</li>
<li>MMB on the canvas ends the current operation.</li>
<li>RMB on the canvas pops up a zoom menu.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Units</h3>
Although the application always "thinks and works in mm", the user can
easily switch to other units on the fly. When the units are switched to
inches, for example, everything in the UI switches to inches, including
the displayed dimensions, the mouse cursor position display, and values
typed in by the user. Adding new units choices is very easy.
<h3>Printing</h3>
<p>No frills. The geometry (and dimensions) are scaled to fit a letter
size format and sent in postscript format to the printer or to file.</p>

<h3>Line Creation Issues</h3>
<p>One little problem I encountered using the canvas occurs during the
creation of lines. The problem occurs when the mouse is used to pick an
item on the canvas and the new line lands on top of the mouse cursor. If
the stacking order is such that the new line is placed "under" the item
being clicked, there is no problem. However, if the stacking order is such
that the new line is placed "on top of" the item being clicked, a series of
"leave_notify" / "enter_notify" events occurs, involving both the clicked
item and the newly created line, and the canvas ends up freezing. I'm not
sure if this is a bug in the canvas or if there is some reason it needs
to work this way, but it presents a problem in this application. To get
around this problem, whenever the user clicks a canvas item while creating
geometry, I have to make sure the new geometry is placed in a group which
is "below" the item being clicked. For this reason, intersection points
belong to a group which is above the geometry group. But what
if other geometry is clicked during the creation of new geometry? The new
geometry would be placed on top of the clicked item and cause the canvas
to freeze. As a solution to this problem, all new geometry is added to a
temporary group, placed just below the geometry group. Then, after the
mouse cursor leaves the clicked item(s), the new geometry is reparented
into the geometry group. The call to reparent the new geometry items is
made from the motion_notify event over the blank canvas.</p>
<h3>Zoom issues</h3>
<p>By clicking the RMB over the empty canvas, a zoom menu is popped up,
presenting various windowing and zooming options. When zooming in or out,
the canvas.set_pixels_per_unit(scale) method is called, and if the value
of scale is significantly higher than about 15 or so, vast amounts of
memory are consumed, sometimes resulting in a segfault. I have therefore
limited the maximum zoom-in scale to 15 to avoid this problem. I haven't
figured out how to fix this problem yet.</p>
<h4>In Summary</h4>
<p>I would say the experiment has been only a moderate success, at best.
It is true that using python and the Gnome canvas, I have been able to
achieve a moderate level of CAD functionality with a relatively small amount
of code. But problems such as the zooming-in problem remain. Also, I noticed
some other zoom related problems: When zoomed way out, panning gets jumpy and
the dimension arrows get distorted, too. And after repeated "zoom to fit",
the app crashes. So I'm putting it on the shelf, for now. </p>
