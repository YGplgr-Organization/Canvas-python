2005-1-12	0.2.1
	Fixed dxf ARC entities so they load in OK now. Also added check
	for metric / english units and (hopefully) apply the right scale
	to imported drawings.

2005-1-12	0.2
	dxf save and load are now functional, in a limited way.
	Only LINE, CIRCLE, and ARC entities are supported, and this
	functionality has been checked out against only one commercial
	CAD vendor (CoCreate). Loading dxf ARC entities is not working
	correctly yet. (They come in as circles.)

2005-1-9	0.1.7
	Added a bunch of math function buttons to calculator. Adjusted
	the padx value of some of the buttons improving its appearance.
	Also, fixed the recall function to rotate the stack up rather
	than wipe out the value in the x-register.
	
	Fixed the problem in "box select" mode, where the selection box
	would not go away when the command was terminated by MMB.
	
	Added a nifty little coordinate display showing the (x, y)
	coordinate values of a line's end point relative to its starting
	point during the "rubber line" mode.
	
	Added file dxf.py, which hopes to be able to someday support dxf
	load/save. So far, it is a standalone dxf to cadvas translator
	and it only supports the LINE entity.
	
2005-1-6	0.1.6
	I'm bored so I decided to work on this again. I haven't looked at it in
	almost a year, and it took me a while to remember how it works, so the
	first thing I did (after reaquanting myself) is expand on the
	documentation. Then I made a few small fixes:
	
	I added the abilitiy to select lists of items for certain operations,
	such as delete_element and translate. When an operation enables this
	mode, 2 extra buttons show up in the RMB popup menu: "Start list" and
	"End list".
	
	Fixed file_Saveas to update self.filename to the new "saved as" name.
	
	Units are now saved and loaded with a drawing, so it's no longer
	neccesary to change the units from mm to feet every time a floorplan
	is loaded.
	
	Measure commands would produce an error if the calculator were not
	running. Now, the calculator just starts automatically if a measure
	command needs to write to it.

	methods, a few geometry modification methods (split, join, fillet, and
	move), save, load, (ps)print, zoom & pan, view fit, units, measure,
	linear dimensioning (horiz, vert, parallel), text create & move, and
